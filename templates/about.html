<p>
	The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in Bree which kindled Thorin's interest in
	recapturing his long lost family inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the king of the Lonely Mountain when
	Smaug came and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the Shire,
	Gandalf decided to add Bilbo to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to force.
	Gandalf also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash
	action. The superstitious Dwarves also considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned to
	leave on other business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their party.

		<h3>Thorin Oakenshield</h3>
		<p>
			In the year TA 2746, Thorin II was born to Dwarven prince Thráin II in the mountain city of The Lonely
			Mountain. Early in his youth, he and the other Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the
			dragon Smaug in TA 2770. While in exile, he quickly grew to become a capable warrior. This was demonstrated
			when he participated in the Battle of Azanulbizar in TA 2799. He marched with one of the Dwarven armies
			beneath the East-gate of Moria. At some point in the fighting, his shield broke, and using an oaken tree
			branch found on the floor as a shield, he gained the epithet "Oakenshield," which would remain with him even
			in death.

		<h3>Bilbo Baggins</h3>
		<p>
			Bilbo Baggins was a Hobbit of the Shire, the main protagonist of The Hobbit and a secondary character in The Lord of the Rings.

Gandalf suggested Bilbo Baggins to be hired by Thorin and Company to be their burglar in the Quest of Erebor, and later fought in the Battle of the Five Armies. Bilbo was also one of the bearers of the One Ring, and the first to voluntarily give it up, although with some difficulty. He wrote many of his adventures in a book he called There and Back Again. Bilbo adopted his second-cousin-once-removed Frodo Baggins to be his heir after his parents, Drogo Baggins and Primula Brandybuck, drowned in the Brandywine River.
